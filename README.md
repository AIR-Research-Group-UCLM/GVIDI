## Description
GVIDI is a novel hardware and software solution that combines wearables, a mobile application, and AR. Hikers wear the device on their wrist. The mobile application is designed to receive and process data for both individuals and groups. GVIDI also relies on a web system that stores expedition data in the cloud for real-time and post-hike consultation from anywhere. Finally, GVIDI integrates an AR module that displays virtual information about the real environment to facilitate understanding of the current situation.

GVIDI has the ability to record all the activities of an expedition, creating datasets that reflect environmental data, personal measurements of each member of the group (location, movement, and health parameters), and group activities. Each dataset generated and recorded by an expedition is a rich source of information for analysis in various scientific fields such as public health, psychology, physiology, sociology, geography, and artificial intelligence.

The next figure gives a graphical overview of GVIDI, where three main components can be distinguished.
